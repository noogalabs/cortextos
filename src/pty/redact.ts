/**
 * PTY output redaction.
 *
 * Secret-bearing output can reach the PTY capture stream whenever an agent
 * runs a shell command that prints credentials — curl -v against an
 * authenticated endpoint, wget --debug, openssl s_client, dumping a cookie
 * jar, etc. The PTY's OutputBuffer ring captures everything the child
 * process emits and also streams it verbatim to a persisted stdout.log.
 * Without redaction, any JWT, bearer token, or session cookie that happens
 * to appear in the agent's terminal ends up persisted to disk indefinitely.
 *
 * Origin: discovered via a baseline gitleaks audit of agent stdout logs
 * which found 16 JWTs (`authjs.session-token=eyJ...`) emitted to stdout
 * by `curl -v` against an authenticated NextAuth endpoint. Initial
 * hypothesis was that a logging code path was at fault; the actual cause
 * turned out to be agent-level shell commands the PTY captured faithfully.
 * The fix therefore lives at the PTY layer (defense-in-depth for any
 * future exposure via any tool) rather than in an individual code path.
 *
 * Chunk-boundary handling: PTY data arrives in OS-buffered chunks
 * (typically 4KB on Linux). If a chunk boundary falls inside a JWT,
 * neither chunk matches the regex on its own. `splitTrailingPartialJwt`
 * closes this gap: OutputBuffer.push() holds back a trailing substring
 * that could be the prefix of a JWT and prepends it to the next chunk,
 * so the reassembled token is redacted before anything reaches the disk
 * log. The holdback is bounded (MAX_PARTIAL_HOLDBACK) so legitimate
 * base64 output that merely starts with `eyJ` cannot be withheld
 * indefinitely. See the chunk-boundary tests in output-buffer.test.ts.
