# Trending Repo Scout

Run one safe daily scanner that finds a small number of potentially useful public repos and turns them into a concise borrow digest for Dane. This is an external-pattern scout, not an implementation step.

## Hard Rules

1. **Public source only.** Use GitHub Trending public pages and public repos/packages only.
2. **Read/search/graph only.** Never execute fetched repo code, package managers, tests, examples, binaries, Dockerfiles, Makefiles, hooks, or generated commands.
3. **Use the permanent pinned opensrc install.** Set `OPENSRC_HOME=${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/opensrc-cache` and use `${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/opensrc-install/node_modules/.bin/opensrc`. The installed package must remain `opensrc 0.7.2`.
4. **Cheap relevance filter first.** Fetch and parse top trending entries, then classify using only repo slug, description, topics if present, and star-delta text. Do not fetch source before the cheap filter passes.
5. **Hard cap three deep studies.** If more than three pass, study the top three by relevance score and count the rest as not studied.
6. **Fail loud on source failure.** If GitHub Trending cannot be fetched or parsed, the digest must say `source unavailable`. Do not report that as `0 relevant`.
7. **Digest once.** Send Dane one markdown bus message with counts and BORROW / WATCHLIST / SKIP buckets. Do not spam every candidate.
8. **Implementation is a separate gate.** Borrow findings are recommendations only.

## Steps

1. **Fetch GitHub Trending.**
   ```bash
   SCOUT_AGENT="${CTX_AGENT_NAME:?CTX_AGENT_NAME is required for agent-scoped scout state}"
   SCOUT_STATE="${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}"
   SCOUT_OUT="${SCOUT_STATE}/trending-repo-scout"
   mkdir -p "$SCOUT_OUT"
   TRENDING_HTML="${SCOUT_OUT}/github-trending-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).html"
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/trending -o "$TRENDING_HTML"
   test -s "$TRENDING_HTML"
   ```
   If fetch fails or the file is empty, send Dane a digest with `source unavailable` and stop.

2. **Parse top candidates cheaply.**
   Extract roughly the top 10-15 repo slugs plus descriptions from the HTML. Use a lightweight parser such as Ruby Nokogiri if installed, Python standard library, or conservative text extraction. GitHub Trending repo links may have attributes before `href`, so the repo-link matcher must allow `<a ... href="/owner/repo" ...>` rather than only `<a href=...>`. Prefer parsing `<article class="Box-row">` blocks that contain `TRENDING_REPOSITORIES_PAGE` or `octicon-repo`. Discard non-repo GitHub links before scoring, including owners or paths such as `sponsors`, `apps`, `topics`, `features`, `marketplace`, `collections`, `explore`, and links with more or fewer than two path components. If zero repo slugs are extracted after filtering, send Dane `source unavailable` and stop.

3. **Cheap relevance filter.**
   Run one Haiku-class cheap classification pass over only the parsed slug, description, topics, and star-delta text. If the model path is temporarily unavailable, fall back to a keyword-weighted score and mark the digest as `classification degraded`. In-lane domains:
   - agents, agent frameworks, AI orchestration, LLM tooling, MCP, workflow automation, dev tooling, property management.

   Do not deep-study all parsed repos. Keep at most the top three passers.

   Use the bundled classifier helper so the Haiku path is concrete and repeatable:
   ```bash
   SEEN_STATE="${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/trending-scout-seen.json"
   CLASSIFIER=""
   for candidate in \
     "$PWD/plugins/cortextos-agent-skills/skills/trending-repo-scout/scripts/classify-trending.mjs" \
     "$PWD/.claude/skills/trending-repo-scout/scripts/classify-trending.mjs"
   do
     if [ -f "$candidate" ]; then
       CLASSIFIER="$candidate"
       break
     fi
   done
   if [ -z "$CLASSIFIER" ]; then
     echo "trending-repo-scout classifier helper missing; refusing silent keyword-only mode"
     exit 1
   fi
   node "$CLASSIFIER" "$CANDIDATES_JSON" "$SEEN_STATE" "$SCORED_JSON"
   jq -e '.classification | test("^haiku:")' "$SCORED_JSON" >/dev/null || {
     echo "classification degraded: keyword fallback"
   }
   ```
   The helper invokes `claude -p --model haiku` with tools disabled and returns the same `scored.json` shape used by the digest. If that command fails, the helper falls back to keyword scoring and includes `classifier_error`; the digest must report the degraded state.

4. **Dedup.**
   Read `${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/trending-scout-seen.json` if present. Skip repos studied in the last 14 days unless the repo looks especially relevant. Update this file after the digest is sent.

5. **Deep-study at most three.**
   For each selected repo:
   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail
   SOURCE_SPEC="owner/repo"
   case "$SOURCE_SPEC" in
     *[!A-Za-z0-9._~:/@+-]*)
       echo "Unsupported source spec characters; refusing opensrc"
       exit 1
       ;;
   esac
   export OPENSRC_HOME="${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/opensrc-cache"
   OPENSRC_BIN="${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/opensrc-install/node_modules/.bin/opensrc"
   if [ "$("$OPENSRC_BIN" --version 2>/dev/null)" != "opensrc 0.7.2" ]; then
     echo "opensrc 0.7.2 is required at $OPENSRC_BIN; refusing to fetch source"
     exit 1
   fi
   LOCAL_PATH="$("$OPENSRC_BIN" path "$SOURCE_SPEC")"
   if [ ! -d "$LOCAL_PATH" ]; then
     echo "opensrc did not resolve a local source directory for $SOURCE_SPEC; refusing to continue"
     exit 1
   fi
   STUDY_SLUG="${SOURCE_SPEC//\//-}"
   STUDY_OUT="${SCOUT_OUT}/studies/${STUDY_SLUG}"
   mkdir -p "$STUDY_OUT"
   ```
   Then run the existing study-and-borrow flow: map with `rg`/`find`, graph a temporary copy of the source, and read/search/graph only. Do not run anything from inside `LOCAL_PATH`, and do not write `graphify-out/` into the opensrc cache:
   ```bash
   rg --files "$LOCAL_PATH" | sed -n '1,160p' > "$STUDY_OUT/files.txt"
   find "$LOCAL_PATH" -maxdepth 2 -type f \( -name 'README*' -o -name 'package.json' -o -name 'pyproject.toml' -o -name 'Cargo.toml' -o -name 'go.mod' \) > "$STUDY_OUT/manifests.txt"

   SAFE_SOURCE="$STUDY_OUT/source-copy"
   rm -rf "$SAFE_SOURCE" "$STUDY_OUT/graphify-out"
   mkdir -p "$SAFE_SOURCE"
   rsync -a --delete --exclude 'graphify-out' "$LOCAL_PATH"/ "$SAFE_SOURCE"/
   if ! graphify update "$SAFE_SOURCE" --force; then
     echo "graphify failed for $SOURCE_SPEC; noting failure and continuing"
     rm -rf "$SAFE_SOURCE"
     continue
   fi
   if [ ! -f "$SAFE_SOURCE/graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md" ]; then
     echo "graphify did not produce GRAPH_REPORT.md for $SOURCE_SPEC; noting failure and continuing"
     rm -rf "$SAFE_SOURCE"
     continue
   else
     cp -R "$SAFE_SOURCE/graphify-out" "$STUDY_OUT/graphify-out"
   fi
   rm -rf "$SAFE_SOURCE"
   ```

6. **Write and send the digest.**
   Write a local report under `${CTX_ROOT}/state/${SCOUT_AGENT}/trending-repo-scout/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, then send one bus message:
   ```bash
   cortextos bus send-message dane normal "$(cat "$REPORT")"
   ```

   Digest shape:
   ```markdown
   # Trending Repo Scout - YYYY-MM-DD

   Source: GitHub Trending
   Counts: N parsed, M relevance-pass, K studied, R counted-not-studied, S skipped-recently

   ## BORROW
   - owner/repo — file:line — one-line rationale

   ## WATCHLIST
   - owner/repo — why it might matter later

   ## SKIP
   - Count only for relevance-filter skips; list only studied repos that were inspected and rejected.
   ```

7. **Log and close the cron loop.**
   ```bash
   cortextos bus log-event action research_completed info --meta '{"agent":"'"$SCOUT_AGENT"'","workflow":"trending-repo-scout"}'
   cortextos bus update-cron-fire trending-repo-scout --interval "0 6 * * *"
   ```
