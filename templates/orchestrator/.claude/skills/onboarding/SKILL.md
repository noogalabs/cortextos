# Onboarding

This skill runs on first boot or when explicitly triggered. It is the only thing you should do until it is complete.

---

## Step 0: Bootstrap orientation (Phase 1 — for operators starting from zero)

The full, doc-independent zero-to-fleet install sequence lives locally at
`SKOOL-INSTALL.md` in the AscendOps project root (delivered by a successful
install — do NOT rely on any external/Skool link, which may render blank). If the
operator hasn't completed bootstrap, point them there. The two phases:

- **Phase 1 — Bootstrap (must be done before this skill matters):** create prereq
  accounts (GitHub, Anthropic/Claude, Google, Telegram, optional Telnyx) → install
  Claude Code (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` + `claude login`) → run
  the installer (`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noogalabs/ascendops/main/install.mjs | node`)
  → open `~/ascendops` in Claude Code → create a Telegram bot per agent with auto
  chat_id capture (below).
- **Phase 2 — Onboarding (this skill):** configure the agent for the operator's PM
  business + software.

**Agent order is data-driven, and you (EA/orchestrator) come FIRST** — you
coordinate the rest. After you, the operator brings up the required core agents, THEN the optional agents. Follow the
ordered roster table in `SKOOL-INSTALL.md` top-to-bottom; create + onboard each
required agent before any optional one.

### Bot setup walkthrough (baked in here so it works even if SKOOL-INSTALL.md is missing)

For THIS agent, if its `.env` has no `BOT_TOKEN`/`CHAT_ID` yet:

1. In Telegram, message **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → pick a display name → pick a
   username ending in `bot`. Copy the **BOT_TOKEN** it returns (looks like
   `123456789:AA...`).
2. Auto-capture the chat_id (no manual hunting) — run:
   ```bash
   cortextos detect-chat-id --agent "$CTX_AGENT_NAME" --org "$CTX_ORG"
   ```
   Paste the token when asked, then **send `/start` to the bot `@username` it
   prints**. It captures `CHAT_ID` + `ALLOWED_USER` the moment you message the bot
   and writes `BOT_TOKEN`/`CHAT_ID`/`ALLOWED_USER` into this agent's `.env`
   (chmod 600). It times out cleanly if you wait too long — just re-run it.
   (Interactive alternative: `cortextos bot create "$CTX_AGENT_NAME"`.)

Only after the bot is wired does the rest of onboarding (below) run.

### Optional AscendOps support access

Ask the operator whether they want to enable AscendOps support access for this
agent so David can help through the agent's Telegram bot. Default to **No**. If
they choose yes, run:

```bash
cortextos support-access enable --agent "$CTX_AGENT_NAME" --org "$CTX_ORG"
```

Show the command output, including the share-instruction for David. If they choose
no, continue onboarding and note they can enable or disable it later with
`cortextos support-access`.

---

## Step 1: Check onboarding status

```bash
[[ -f "${CTX_ROOT}/state/${CTX_AGENT_NAME}/.onboarded" ]] && echo "ONBOARDED" || echo "NEEDS_ONBOARDING"
```

If already `ONBOARDED`, skip to normal session start. Do not re-run onboarding unless the user explicitly requests it.

---

## Step 2: Read ONBOARDING.md

```bash
cat ONBOARDING.md
```

This file contains the full onboarding protocol for your specific agent role. Follow every step exactly. Do not improvise.

---

## Step 3: What onboarding establishes

Onboarding must complete all of the following before you are considered functional:

| Item | File written |
|------|-------------|
| Your name, role, emoji, and identity | `IDENTITY.md` |
| Your behavior, autonomy rules, and mode | `SOUL.md` |
| Your current goals and focus | `GOALS.md` |
| User preferences and context | `USER.md` |
| Guardrails and patterns to avoid | `GUARDRAILS.md` |
| Telegram bot connected and tested | `.env` (BOT_TOKEN, CHAT_ID) |
| Crons configured and running | `config.json` |
| .onboarded flag written | `$CTX_ROOT/state/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/.onboarded` |

---

## Step 4: Mark complete

When all steps in ONBOARDING.md are done:

```bash
mkdir -p "$CTX_ROOT/state/$CTX_AGENT_NAME"
touch "$CTX_ROOT/state/$CTX_AGENT_NAME/.onboarded"
```

Then notify the user via Telegram that you are online and ready.

---

## If Onboarding Is Interrupted

If a session crash or restart interrupts onboarding mid-way:

1. Check which steps completed (look at which files exist)
2. Resume from the first incomplete step
3. Do NOT restart from the beginning if some steps already completed
4. Re-run `/onboarding` if needed to trigger this skill again

---

## Critical Rules

- Do NOT send a Telegram message claiming you are online until onboarding is complete
- Do NOT set up crons until IDENTITY.md and GOALS.md are written
- Do NOT start processing user requests until `.onboarded` is written
- The user is waiting — be efficient, but do not skip steps
