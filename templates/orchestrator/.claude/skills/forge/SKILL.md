description: "You MUST use this skill to hunt slippage and turn it into skills — either DETECT (scan a day/agent/domain for a known rule that got missed or the same reasoning done by hand 3+ times, and produce a candidate list) or BUILD (forge a new skill or sharpen an existing one from the candidates, to the locked template, through the load gate). Pass the scope after the command. Detection is cheap and runs nightly; building is real work and runs weekly or on an explicit ask."

**Why this is a forked Opus skill:** the slippage-hunt is heavy reasoning — reading a day of transcripts/events, recognizing that a rule was missed or that the same judgment was reconstructed by hand several times, and deciding whether that becomes a new skill or a sharpening of an existing one. That is exactly the work Opus is for. It is `context: fork` so the heavy pass runs in its own window and the caller's session (an evening/weekly review, or an orchestrator turn) stays lean. The detect pass is cheap-by-cadence (nightly, skip-on-empty); the build pass is deliberate (weekly), so Opus is spent only where the reasoning earns it.

## Purpose

Turn how-we-actually-slipped into rule-baked skills, on a cadence, so slippage stops compounding. The forge is an Opus engine that runs ONE deliberate loop — detect → spec → build → test-it-fires → next-pass-audits-whether-it-fired — over two methods: the **create-new** approach (draft a new skill, the `auto-skill` method) and the **edit-existing** approach (audit a skill against a transcript and produce a sharpening diff, the `skill-optimizer` method). The forge DOES this work itself; it invokes the `auto-skill` / `skill-optimizer` skills opportunistically when they are loadable in the running agent, but does NOT hard-depend on them, so the engine is self-contained and portable to any orchestrator agent. It runs on everything, not just maintenance.

## Steps

1. **Parse the scope** from `$ARGUMENTS`: `<domain> [date|agent]` and the mode. Examples: `/forge maintenance 2026-06-05` (detect a domain on a day), `/forge blue` (detect an agent), `/forge --build` (run the weekly build over the accumulated candidate list). Default mode = **detect** unless `--build` is passed.

2. **DETECT mode (daily-light — never builds here):**
   - **Cost-guard first:** if the scope has no meaningful activity and no `forge_candidate` events, STOP — do not spend the Opus pass on an empty day. Return "no candidates."
   - Scan the scope's transcripts + event logs (sweep `forge_candidate` events FIRST — those are real misses that already reached David) for two signals: **(a)** a known rule that got missed, **(b)** the same reasoning done by hand 3+ times with no skill covering it.
   - For each signal, emit a **candidate**: the slippage + the tied real incident (meld/PR/date — REQUIRED) + a proposed hard rule + a **create-vs-edit verdict** (no skill covers it → create-new; a skill under-fired or a covered area newly slipped → edit-existing).
   - **PERSIST every HIGH candidate durably before returning** — detect runs unattended (nightly, via the evening-review hook), so its output MUST survive the session or the weekly build loses it. Write each candidate to the durable forge candidate queue: emit a `forge_candidate` event per candidate (preferred — same store the cost-guard and instant-on-miss already use) AND/OR append it to the run log `docs/ephemeral/forge-runs/candidates.md`. The session-visible list is a convenience copy; the persisted records are the source of truth the weekly build reads.
   - Output = the HIGH-confidence candidate list (to the caller) PLUS the durable persistence above. **Build nothing.**

3. **BUILD mode (weekly-heavy or explicit `--build`):**
   - **Read the accumulated candidate list from the durable forge candidate queue** — the `forge_candidate` events (and/or `docs/ephemeral/forge-runs/candidates.md`) persisted by the detect passes since the last build. Do NOT rely on an in-session list; the candidates were found on prior unattended runs. For each candidate, run the matching method (the forge performs the method itself; if the named helper skill is loadable in the running agent, delegate to it — but never block on it being present):
     - **Create-new** (the `auto-skill` method): draft a new skill to the locked template (frontmatter + steps + hard rules), bake the tied-incident rule, set the model tier + `context: fork`, and route the tracked home (role-specific → role template; shareable → `community/skills/` via skill-autopr).
     - **Edit-existing** (the `skill-optimizer` method): audit the relevant transcript against the target SKILL.md, produce a sharpening diff (tighten triggers / add a hard rule / fix structure), and own the gate + apply + re-activate.
   - Assemble the change-set as SPECS, not merges. Role-split: detection + the hard-rule spec are the orchestrator's judgment lane; the build/PR/wire is dev-side (Collie/Codie).

4. **Gate every output through the combined load gate** (see hard rule 4) and the two-step registration (tracked-source PR → runtime activation), then **return**: in detect, the candidate list; in build, the gated change-set + which skills are ready to ship/sharpen.

5. **Close the loop:** the next forge pass audits whether each shipped skill actually FIRED on its triggers. A skill that shipped but never fired is itself a candidate (its description/triggers under-fired).

## Hard rules — these fire EVERY time (the slippage these prevent is real)

1. **Every candidate ties to a REAL incident.** Cite the meld/PR/date that proves the slippage. No speculative skills "we might need" — the forge builds from where we actually slipped, not from imagination. (Speculative-concerns-are-not-current-blockers, applied to skill creation.)

2. **No skill ships without all three features.** Model tier + `context: fork` (the fork works both directions — heavy reasoning forks UP to Opus, rote forks DOWN to Haiku), `$ARGUMENTS`, and an imperative `description` + a separate `triggers` array. A skill missing any of the three is not done.

3. **Detect never builds at night; build never rushes.** The daily-light pass DETECTS only (cheap, keeps slippage from compounding). Building a skill well is real work — it happens on the weekly pass or an explicit `--build`, never as a nightly rush. This also respects nighttime mode: no live changes overnight.

4. **The frontmatter LOAD GATE is mandatory and uses a REAL YAML parser — never regex.** The harness skill loader parses frontmatter as YAML; an unquoted colon-space in the description (e.g. `intake: read`) is rejected (`mapping values are not allowed`) → the skill silently fails to load and is undiscoverable. Regex-based `list-skills` and regex frontmatter smoke MASK this (PR #99, 2026-06-06). So the gate is ONE combined check, all three required: **does it parse (real YAML) → is it discoverable → does it fire on its trigger** in the target agent's context. **Quote every free-text frontmatter value** (description especially) so punctuation cannot reintroduce the break; the text stays verbatim, only wrapped in quotes.

5. **Every referenced skill must resolve FROM THE TARGET HOME/RUNTIME — not just exist somewhere.** If a forged skill hands off to or names another skill, verify that name resolves where the skill will actually run: `git ls-files` for the tracked home (NOT an unscoped `find`, which sweeps gitignored runtime dirs and gives a false green), plus the running agent's runtime if it activates there. A handoff to a name that is unresolvable from the target = a dead activation (PR #99 `vendor-assign` dangle: a planned-but-unbuilt name; PR #104: `skill-optimizer` tracked nowhere + `auto-skill` absent from the forge home — an unscoped find masked both). Prefer naming a method over hard-invoking a skill when the dependency may not be loadable.

6. **Two-step registration, always.** Live agent skill dirs (`<agent>/.claude/skills/`) are gitignored runtime — NOT a PR target. Register in two steps: tracked source (role template or `community/skills/`) via PR → Codex + review → Dane gate; THEN runtime activation (identical file into the live gitignored dir) → in-context trigger-fire smoke → agent heads-up. Never a single write to a gitignored live dir.

7. **The forge produces SPECS + change-sets, not auto-merges.** No skill the forge builds is merged or activated without the human/orchestrator gate. The forge surfaces; Dane gates; dev-side ships.

## Plumbing — the mechanical layer behind the steps

These scripts live in the framework repo (`$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/`). They are the durable plumbing; the judgment stays in this skill.

**Persist a HIGH candidate (detect, step 2)** — one command dual-persists (run-log append FIRST, then the `forge_candidate` bus event). Refuses candidates with no tied real incident (hard rule 1):

```bash
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-candidates.mjs" emit \
  --skill "<target-or-proposed-name>" --verdict <create-new|edit-existing> \
  --slippage "<what actually slipped>" --incident "<meld/PR/date>" \
  --rule "<proposed hard rule>" --confidence high
```

**Read the accumulated queue (build, step 3)** — merges `forge_candidate` events since the last build marker with pending `docs/ephemeral/forge-runs/candidates.md` entries, dedupes by event id, groups by create-vs-edit verdict:

```bash
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-candidates.mjs" queue
```

**Gate every built/sharpened skill (step 4)** — the combined load gate: real-YAML parse (never regex; fails loud if no real parser) + discoverable + ship features (model tier, `context: fork`, `$ARGUMENTS`, imperative description, triggers) + referenced skills resolve from the target home via `git ls-files`. The trigger-fire smoke remains MANUAL in the target agent's context — the gate prints the exact smoke to run:

```bash
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-load-gate.mjs" <skill-dir> --target-home "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT"
```

**Two-step registration (step 4, hard rule 6)** — `stage` copies into the tracked home and gates it (PR follows; never commits/merges itself); `activate` runs only after the merge + orchestrator gate, copies byte-identical FROM the tracked source, and refuses untracked sources and missing `--gate-approved-by`:

```bash
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-register.mjs" stage --from <built-skill-dir> --home "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/community/skills"
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-register.mjs" activate --from <tracked-skill-dir> --runtime <agent>/.claude/skills --gate-approved-by <name>
```

**Close out a build pass (step 5 hand-off)** — archive the consumed queue into `runs/<build-id>.md` and advance the marker so the next detect window starts clean:

```bash
node "$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/scripts/forge-candidates.mjs" consume --build-id "build-$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

**Known limitation (must close before build-mode goes live):** the build read bounds the *event* store by a single authoritative cutoff, but run-log (`candidates.md`) entries are date-only and are NOT cutoff-bounded — a concurrent `emit` in the ~1 ms window between the cutoff capture and the run-log read can cross the build boundary (consumed this cycle instead of next; near-zero in the single-threaded weekly flow, accepted while forge is dormant). The unified-store fix (precise emit ts on run-log entries + the same cutoff bound, or a queue/consume atomicity lock) is **`task_1781104449215_29277678`** — a HARD BLOCKER before forge build-mode/consume is activated live. See `scripts/forge-candidates.mjs` (candidates.md read).

## Invocation example

```
/forge maintenance 2026-06-05
/forge blue
/forge --build
```

The text after the command replaces `$ARGUMENTS`. The caller's session stays on its lean model; this engine runs on Opus in its own fork. In **detect** it returns a HIGH-confidence candidate list (slippage + tied incident + proposed rule + create-vs-edit verdict), or "no candidates" when the cost-guard trips on an empty scope. In **build** it returns a gated change-set of new/sharpened skill specs for dev-side to ship through the two-step registration.
